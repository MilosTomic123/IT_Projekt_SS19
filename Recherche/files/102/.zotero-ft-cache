    Strategic issues in customer relationship management (CRM) implementation


Strategic issues in customer relationship management (CRM) implementation

Author(s):
    Christopher Bull (Department of Business Information Technology, Manchester Metropolitan University Business School, Manchester, UK)

Abstract:

    The number of customer relationship management (CRM) implementations has grown dramatically in recent years. However, few academic studies of the issues associated with the implementation of the concept are available. This paper offers a modest contribution through the analysis of a case study of a CRM implementation at a UK‐based manufacturing company. The case study illustrates that CRM is a complex and holistic concept, organised around business processes and the integration of information technologies. The study also highlights that implementing CRM requires effective leadership, sourcing, targeting and evaluation strategies.
